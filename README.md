# Identifying Growth Opportunities and Operational Gaps at Plant Co.

## by Lucila Aldana Quiñonez | Marketing Data Analyst

This project analyzes business performance at Plant Co. to identify growth opportunities, operational inefficiencies, and revenue gaps across products and customer segments.

The objective was to evaluate sales performance, profitability, and operational metrics to uncover structural weaknesses and provide data-driven recommendations to improve revenue growth and operational efficiency.

The analysis examines:

• Total revenue, profit, and order volume trends over time

• Profit margin performance by product category

• Sales contribution by product type and segment

• Underperforming products with declining margins

• Customer purchasing behavior and segment contribution

• Revenue distribution across channels and time periods

• Operational gaps impacting profitability and growth

Interactive filters allow stakeholders to explore performance by time period, product category, and customer segment to isolate trends and identify specific drivers of revenue volatility.

Key insights supported by the analysis include identifying low-margin product lines, detecting revenue concentration risks, uncovering operational bottlenecks affecting profitability, and highlighting high-growth segments with expansion potential.

The project simulates a real-world business diagnostic scenario where performance evaluation and strategic analysis are used to support executive decision-making, improve operational alignment, and guide sustainable growth initiatives.
